# Final Project

Kin Loh, kmloh@ucsd.edu

## Abstract Proposal

In this final project, we continue to explore futher on one of our past project which transforms a cat into a tiger using cycleGAN. We continue to explore different technique to do the transformation of a cat into a tiger. Our idea is to use HED model to generate contour images of cats, and at the same time, pix2pix model is used to train sketches of tiger. The generated contour images of cats are then used as the input test for the generator of pix2pix tiger trained model.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
